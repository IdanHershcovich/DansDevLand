// About me Text

// Idan Hershcovich
// Computer Science graduate with a game development concentration. 

// Born in the sunshine state of Florida but lived 18 years in the beautiful country of Panama before returning to the US for my college years.
// I first got interested in software and technology ever since I discovered jailbroken iPhones back in high-school and the endless possibilities it had.
// I've been tinkering with devices ever since. When I started my formal education at Drexel, I fell in love with new technologies. The fast-paced environment made discovering technologies 
// easy, but there was never enough time to deep-dive into them. Because of this, I'm always looking for my next obsession and my next opportunity to dig deeper.
// When I'm not working, I can often be found playing video games or card games, spending time with friends or making a mess of my desk with my Raspberry Pi and assorted parts.
